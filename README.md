Designed for community servers and league servers. A drag and drop solution to support admins in keeping your server clean of hackers.
This being a server-side plugin it is not (and will never be) a catch all solution. You should always have some method of human intervention to investigate those that fall through the net.

Latest builds and auto updates are hosted on: https://onlinefightingleague.com/

# What is OFL?
The Online Fighting League was and still is an esport event organiser. But is slowly moving towards hosting an online matchmaking system and league automation system for third-party organisers to utilise, allowing them to focus on what is important in an event. If you wish to help us then you can join our discord or contact us through our [Support Site](https://support.onlinefigthingleague.com). We currently do not accept donations but will be opening a donation portal to support us soon.

All our products, open source, free, proprietary and whatever else, are made with <3 from the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

This update included a lot of quality of life updates. Mainly making it easier for people to code their own improvements. We are always open to pull requests that improve the plugin.
